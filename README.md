Welcome to Liri!  LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

To utilize this app, start in your terminal and enter "node" and the name of the file -- liri.js.  From there, you can elect to pull tweets (type "my-tweets), spotify a song (type "spotify-this-song" and the name of the song), or pull information about a movie (type "movie-this" and the name of the movie).  You can also type "do-what-it-says" and the command you want (i.e., "spotify-this-song, and the name of the song" -- make sure to include quotation marks).  If you do not elect a movie or a song, Liri will select one for you.

Enjoy!
